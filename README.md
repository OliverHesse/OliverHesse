Hi I'm Oliver. im just someone who gets that itch to program and sometimes makes usefull things.

I am experienced with JavaScript, Java, and Python. I have some experience with Kotlin and C#, and I am currently exploring Rust and C++

### projects I am activly working on right now:

[EasyGui](https://github.com/OliverHesse/EasyGui)
- a minecraft mod that tries to streamline the process of creating GUI!

Ascension (currently private. discord for sneak peeks: [Jade Project](https://discord.gg/YY9pZpeX))
- a mod that aims to bring the experience of cultivation to minecraft

[Formation Arrays](https://github.com/OliverHesse/Formation-Arrays)
- a mod that brings formations to minecraft. whilst it will be part of the official Ascension experience it will be its own standalone mod<br> so any developers working on cultivation/xianxia mods can use it
